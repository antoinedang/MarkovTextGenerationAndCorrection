# Markov Text Generation And Correction

The unigram, bigram, and trigram probability distributions as well as the vocabulary used for this assignment are in the data folder.

To generate sentences, run generate_text.py (it will use 5 different np.random seeds and a Markov Model to generate 5 example sentences).

To correct "noisy" input sentences, run correct_text.py. It will output 5 input/output pairs from the assignment using the Viterbi algorithm and a first-order Hidden Markov Model.

In the scope of ECSE 526.
